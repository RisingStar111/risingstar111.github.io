<div class="home">

    Maybe I'll work out a homepage eventually.
    For now, just use the navigation toolbar at the top of the page.
    <br>
    I recommend only checking out <a class="page-link" href="/pathology/">Pathology levels</a> as it's the only thing worth looking at unless you really want to make a level for a niche minesweeper game.
