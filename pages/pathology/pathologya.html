            <p><a href="https://pathology.thinky.gg">Pathology</a> is a Sokoban variation that adds blocks that cannot be pushed from some directions, walls that can be destroyed by blocks ('holes') and changes the win condition to only require that the player reaches a specific tile.</p>
            <p>An interesting topic in Pathology is of the longest levels of a given level size. There has been a lasting community effort to find these, <a href="https://github.com/sspenst/thinky.gg/wiki/Longest-Pathology-Puzzles-By-Size">detailed here</a> (although not frequently updated), producing some monstrously lengthy small levels.</p>
            <p>An exhaustive search of smaller levels has been performed using a backward search, with more information and playable levels on this site at <a href="/pages/pathology/pathology.html">Longest Levels</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Also on this page is a <a href="/pages/pathology/pathology2.html">sandbox</a> with custom block types and the ability to combine them</p>
